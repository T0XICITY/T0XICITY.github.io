      <description>Cuckoo Sandbox The Cuckoo Sandbox is an open source software for automatic analysis of suspicious files. It uses custom components that monitor the behavior of malicious processes while they are running in an isolated environment.
This manual describes the installation of the Cuckoo Sandbox and its modules. Since setting up the sanbdox can sometimes cause a lot of difficulties I have found some useful workarounds for my issues, which I would like to publish here.</description>

      <description>Google XSS Game In this post I solve the Goolge beginners XSS challanges. These are easier and especially recommended for beginners.
Level 1: Hello, world of XSS This entry-level task is a simple example of XSS. Regardless of whether the payload is passed within the url or directly in the application it will pop.
Payload: // In the input field &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; //In the url frame?query=&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; The code is integrated into the application without further verification, so that the browser understands and executes it as part of the page code.</description>
