      <description>Google XSS Game In this post I solve the Goolge beginners XSS challanges. These are easier and especially recommended for beginners.
Level 1: Hello, world of XSS This entry-level task is a simple example of XSS. No matter which payload is placed where, it is executed.
Payload: // In the input field &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; //In the url frame?query=&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; The code is integrated into the application without further verification, so that the browser understands and executes it as part of the page code.</description>

It will highlight the impact of the malware attack NotPetya, as well as the reaction of politics and computer experts to the occurred events.</description>
