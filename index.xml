      <description>Cuckoo Sandbox Cuckoo Sandbox is an Open Source software for automating analysis of suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an isolated environment.
This manual describes the installation of the Cuckoo Sandbox and its modules. The manual is strongly based on the official documentation of the Cuckoo Sandbox. Nevertheless, some changes have been made, some passages have been shortened or extended to fit the host system.</description>

      <description>Google XSS Game In this post I solve the Goolge beginners XSS challanges. These are easier and especially recommended for beginners.
Level 1: Hello, world of XSS This entry-level task is a simple example of XSS. No matter which payload is placed where, it is executed.
Payload: // In the input field &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; //In the url frame?query=&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(0)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; The code is integrated into the application without further verification, so that the browser understands and executes it as part of the page code.</description>

      <description>Digital warfare in Ukraine This report deals with digital warfare at the example of cyber activities conducted in the Ukrainian conflict. It shows how digital warfare has evolved over time and how Ukraine has become a testing ground for cyberweapons. It discusses the difficulties of assigning and preventing cyber-attacks. Based on a ransomware attack in 2017 this report will show that cyber warfare is much more than a theoretical threat. It will highlight the impact of the malware attack NotPetya, as well as the reaction of politics and computer experts to the occurred events.</description>
